## Automate your Twitter Engagements — Hassle-Free

Engagify is a Twitter Automation Bot that helps you automatically reply to multiple Twitter posts at once — saving time and boosting your engagements without breaking a sweat.

### Why I Built Engagify 🐝
In the Web3 space, engagement is literally currency. During airdrop seasons, the whole game is about supporting others so they can support you back — but manually replying to multiple posts every day felt like a time-wasting chore.

I built Engagify because I needed something that could automate my grind without feeling like a bot — something simple, useful, and human-centered.

What started as just a small personal tool ended up solving a problem I know a lot of others out there are facing too.

This project is me turning that solution into something open source — so anyone can use it, improve it, and build on top of it.
